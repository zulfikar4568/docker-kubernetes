# Setting Up Kubernetes Networking with Weave Net

The Kubernetes networking model creates a virtual network that is accessible to all Pods within the cluster. Weave Net is one of several tools that provide an implementation of the Kubernetes networking model. In this learning activity, you will learn how to configure a Kubernetes Pod network using Weave Net. After completing the activity, you will have hands-on experience implementing networking within a Kubernetes cluster.

Objective:
- Enable IP Forwarding on All Worker Nodes
- Install Weave Net in the Cluster

## Enable IP Forwarding on All Worker Nodes
1. In order for Weave Net to work, we need to make sure IP forwarding is enabled on the worker nodes. Enable it by running the following on both workers:
```bash
sudo sysctl net.ipv4.conf.all.forwarding=1
echo "net.ipv4.conf.all.forwarding=1" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
```
## Install Weave Net in the Cluster
Log in to the controller server in a new terminal window, and then do the following:

1. Get the configuration from Weaveworks like this:
```bash
wget https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/releases/download/v2.6.0/weave-daemonset-k8s-1.11.yaml
```
2. Edit the configuration file with Vim.
```bash
vim weave-daemonset-k8s-1.11.yaml
```
3. Add the following lines (press Escape and then enter i for insert mode):
```yaml
- name: IPALLOC_RANGE
  value: 10.200.0.0/16
The edited code snippet should then look like this:

    spec:
      containers:
        - name: weave
          command:
            - /home/weave/launch.sh
          env:
            - name: IPALLOC_RANGE
              value: 10.200.0.0/16
            - name: HOSTNAME
```
4. Save the file with by pressing Escape and then entering :wq! .

5. Apply the configuration with:
```bash
kubectl apply -f ./weave-daemonset-k8s-1.11.yaml
```
6. Verify that everything is working:
```bash
kubectl get pods -n kube-system
```
7. This should return two weave-net pods and look something like this:
```bash
NAME              READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
weave-net-m69xq   2/2       Running   0          11s
weave-net-vmb2n   2/2       Running   0          11s
```
8. Spin up some Pods to test the networking functionality. First, create an Nginx deployment with two replicas:
```bash
cat << EOF | kubectl apply --kubeconfig admin.kubeconfig -f -
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: nginx
   spec:
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         run: nginx
     replicas: 2
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           run: nginx
       spec:
         containers:
         - name: my-nginx
           image: nginx
           ports:
           - containerPort: 80
EOF
```
9. Create a service for that deployment so that we can test connectivity to services as well:
```bash
kubectl expose deployment/nginx
```
10. Start up another Pod. We will use this Pod to test our networking. We will test whether we can connect to the other Pods and services from this Pod:
```bash
kubectl run busybox --image=radial/busyboxplus:curl --command -- sleep 3600
POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods -l run=busybox -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
```
11. Get the IP addresses of our two nginx Pods (It can take some time before both IPs display).:
```bash
kubectl get ep nginx
```
12. There should be two IP addresses listed under ENDPOINTS. For example:
```bash
NAME      ENDPOINTS                       AGE
nginx     10.200.0.2:80,10.200.128.1:80   50m
```
13. Make sure the busybox Pod can connect to the nginx Pods on both of those IP addresses:
```bash
kubectl exec $POD_NAME -- curl <first nginx pod IP address>
kubectl exec $POD_NAME -- curl <second nginx pod IP address>
```
Both commands should return some HTML with the title "Welcome to Nginx!" This means that we can successfully connect to other Pods.

13. Verify that we can connect to services:
```bash
kubectl get svc
```
14. This should display the IP address for our Nginx service. For example, in this case, the IP is 10.32.0.54:
```bash
NAME         TYPE        CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
kubernetes   ClusterIP   10.32.0.1    <none>        443/TCP   1h
nginx        ClusterIP   10.32.0.54   <none>        80/TCP    53m
```
15. Check that we can access the service from the busybox Pod:
```bash
kubectl exec $POD_NAME -- curl <nginx service IP address>
```
This should also return HTML with the title "Welcome to nginx!"

Getting this response means that we have successfully reached the Nginx service from inside a pod and that our networking configuration is working!
