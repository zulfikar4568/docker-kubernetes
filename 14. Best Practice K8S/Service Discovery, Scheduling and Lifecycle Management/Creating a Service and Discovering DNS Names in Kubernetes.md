# Creating a Service and Discovering DNS Names in Kubernetes

We have been given a three-node cluster. Within that cluster, we must perform the following tasks in order to create a service and resolve the DNS names for that service. We will create the necessary Kubernetes resources in order to perform this DNS query.

To adequately complete this hands-on lab, we must have a working deployment, a working service, and be able to record the DNS name of the service within our Kubernetes cluster.

## Create an nginx deployment, and verify it was successful.
1. Use this command to create an nginx deployment:
```bash
kubectl run nginx --image=nginx
```
2. Use this command to verify deployment was successful:
```bash
kubectl get deployments
```

## Create a service, and verify the service was successful.
1. Use this command to create a service:
```bash
kubectl expose deployment nginx --port 80 --type NodePort
```
2. Use this command to verify the service was created:
```bash
kubectl get services
```

## Create a pod that will allow you to query DNS, and verify itâ€™s been created.
1. Using an editor of your choice (e.g., Vim and the command vim busybox.yaml), enter the following YAML to create the busybox pod spec:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: busybox
spec:
  containers:
  - image: busybox:1.28.4
    command:
      - sleep
      - "3600"
    name: busybox
  restartPolicy: Always
```
2. Use the following command to create the busybox pod:
```bash
kubectl create -f busybox.yaml
```
3. Use the following command to verify the pod was created successfully:
```bash
kubectl get pods
```

## Perform a DNS query to the service.
1. Use the following command to query the DNS name of the nginx service:
```bash
kubectl exec busybox -- nslookup nginx
```
## Record the DNS name.
1. Record the name of:
```bash
[service-name].default.svc.cluster.local
```
